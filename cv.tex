\section{Academic Projects}

\cvitem{September 2019 - March 2020}{\textbf{Iterative Text-to-Image conversion using Recurrent GANs (Tell, Draw, Undo, Repeat)}
\newline 
Dr. Jyothisha J. Nair, Dept. of CSE, ASE, Amritapuri.
\newline 
We propose a novel Recurrent GAN model architecture that can generate 2-D images from input text in an iterative manner. This is different from the one-step text-to-image generation as the model will be given continuous instructions carrying information on how to modify the most recently generated image. The aim of the proposed model is to march towards a complete capacity of interactive text-to-image generation and to enhance the user experience from a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) perspective.
